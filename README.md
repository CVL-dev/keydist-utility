===============

CVL desktop utility for distributing SSH keys

The file `sshKeyDist.py` is to be manually kept in sync with https://github.com/CVL-dev/cvl-fabric-launcher/blob/CVLFAB-545-two-part-ui/sshKeyDist.py


TODO
====

* Events for success, failure, etc.
* Sensible key filename - possible refactor sshKeyDist.py in cvl-fabric-launcher.
* Progress bar.
